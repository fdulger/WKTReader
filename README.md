[Well-known text (WKT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-known_text) is a text markup language for representing vector geometry objects on a map, spatial reference systems of spatial objects and transformations between spatial reference systems. This sample Java code converts String representation of WKT Geometries into Java objects and vice versa.
